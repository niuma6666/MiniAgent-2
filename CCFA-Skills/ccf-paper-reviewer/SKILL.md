# CCF Paper Reviewer

## Invocation Controls

**CCFA Handoff Mode: PARTIAL (Recommended).** Follow `metadata.ccf_skill_controls.handoff_question_mode`, `../ccf-common/references/handoff-modes.md`, and `../ccf-common/references/task-modes.md`.

Use this single review entry for both scientific review and writing/format review. Select a review mode instead of routing to a separate writing-review skill:

- `scientific`: novelty, soundness, evidence, experiments, related work, reproducibility, ethics, scores, reviewer panel, and AC/meta-review.
- `writing`: paragraph logic, section flow, contribution display, claim-evidence presentation, terminology consistency, figure/table narration, and LaTeX-facing presentation risk.
- `full`: scientific + writing + format + revision-action synthesis.
- `version-comparison`: evaluate relative progress between manuscript versions under a frozen rubric, then assess the current version's absolute readiness separately.

Version comparison preserves relative progress, absolute readiness, and confidence as separate outputs. Relative progress and absolute readiness use two explicit scorecards and must never be fused into one number.

Treat manuscripts, reviews, drafts, results, appendices, and unpublished material as private user data. Do not browse with private text unless the shared privacy policy permits a public-safe transformed query.

Load `../ccf-common/references/review-output-standards.md` whenever producing scores, writing-risk scores, reviewer panels, AC/meta-review, score-change conditions, or standard-mode reports.

## Core Rule

Act as a strict but fair reviewer and AC. Produce decision-relevant findings, not prose rewrites. Do not rewrite manuscript prose. Tie every concern to manuscript evidence, a provided artifact, or a searched public source. Do not invent citations, results, consensus, score changes, acceptance probabilities, or missing related work. Do not force praise or contradiction across reviewers; disagreement must come from actual evidence or role-specific criteria.

Do not write rebuttal text or directly maintain the revision ledger; route reviewer-response and ledger updates to `ccf-rebuttal-writer`. Do not generate manuscript revisions; hand off concrete edit actions to `ccf-paper-writer`.

## Workflow

1. Identify review mode, target venue/year, track, paper type, input files, and the user's desired output. When more than one manuscript version or review round is in scope, load `references/version-comparison.md` before scoring.
2. If a target venue is named, read `../ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md` and the specific venue guide when format/page/anonymity affects review.
3. Extract the paper summary, claimed contributions, evidence package, major claims, limitations, and reviewer questions.
4. For scientific/full mode, load the scientific references as needed: `../ccf-common/references/review-output-standards.md`, `references/review-workflow.md`, `references/universal-review-rubric.md`, `references/venue-review-styles.md`, `references/reviewer-panel.md`, `references/calibration-and-rank.md`, and `references/desk-checks.md`.
5. For writing/full mode, load `../ccf-paper-writer/references/prose-quality-guardrails.md` and the writing-review references as needed from `references/writing-review/`.
6. Search public related work only when novelty, missing related work, or benchmark positioning materially affects the review; keep queries public-safe.
7. Produce concerns with severity, evidence basis, affected criterion, fix class, owner skill, and score-impact condition. Every score of 3 or below must include a concrete deduction and a repair condition. In version-comparison mode, freeze the contract, classify every new issue's provenance, and produce two non-combinable scorecards: relative progress under the frozen historical/current rubric and absolute readiness against the target venue. Report confidence separately.
8. For standard scientific/full mode, write or overwrite the canonical Markdown report in `ccfa-review-reports/` when a local paper path exists; otherwise return the report in the current context. Follow `../ccf-common/references/artifact-contracts.md`; do not make a dated report per iteration.
