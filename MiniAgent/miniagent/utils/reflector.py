User Query: {query}

1. Accuracy: Is the information accurate?
2. Relevance: Does the response fully answer the user's query?
3. Completeness: Does it cover all important aspects?
4. Clarity: Is the expression clear and understandable?
5. Logicality: Are the arguments logical?
6. Format: Is the format appropriate and easy to read?

If there are obvious issues with the current response, please provide an improved response. If the current response is already good, please state "Current response is already good" and return the original response.
